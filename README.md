## Features

- **Keyword Input**: Users can input any keyword, and the application will provide a relevant quote.
- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive and works well on all devices (desktops, tablets, and mobile phones).
- **Random Quotes**: If no keyword is entered, the app generates random quotes.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: Users can toggle between light and dark themes for better accessibility.
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Quotes can easily be copied with a single click.
- **Creative Design**: A clean and minimalist design for an enjoyable user experience.
